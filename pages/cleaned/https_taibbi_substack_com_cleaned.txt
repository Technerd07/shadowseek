First place for great reporting. First place for cleverness and creativity. The only place for hot takes on current events. Prepare to arrive at the end of his pieces well-informed, and don't be surprised because you laughed the whole way. ” Nicole Jones Herron, Jones Notebook “I started reading Matt Taibbi nearly twenty years ago when he was following in Hunter S. Thompson's footsteps at Rolling Stone and he's only gotten better with age. He's covered the worlds of politics, banking, criminal justice reform and culture, always with a fierce commitment to the cause of the underdog.” MJT, The Armchair Strategist “The current most important reporter in the world. #TwitterFiles” Etana Hecht, Clown World - Honk This site requires JavaScript to run correctly.
