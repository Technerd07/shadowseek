Using an R&D kit from a company called Etherdyne Technologies, Matthew Perks created a wooden desk that’s capable of powering everything on it, including a mouse, keyboard, speakers, and a display, without a single visible wire. The technology is similar in principle to what’s found in Qi chargers but a hidden wire running around the perimeter of the desk generates a 3D field capable of wirelessly powering devices at a short distance.

Google is rolling out a new Gemini AI-powered feature to users with eligible Google Workspace or Google AI plans that pops up a “Catch me up” shortcut to go over recent edits in Google Docs, as well as comments on other types of files, complete with a warning that “Gemini may display inaccurate info.” It’s supposed to roll out over the next couple of weeks, providing either a high-level summary across all of your files in the sidebar or overviews of changes to a specific file via a new activity indicator. Google Drive “Catch me up” Image: Google R Quote Richard Lawler12:58 AM UTC Link It’s time for us to talk about Tronc. The New York Times is reporting on Ripple, a Washington Post initiative that’s apparently looking to open up its opinion pages to writing from “...from other newspapers across America, writers on Substack and eventually nonprofessional writers.” That last bullet point would reportedly be assisted by the “Ember” AI writing coach with a paint-by-numbers approach to creating strong stories. As Liz’s thread goes on to point out, beyond the Forbes and Huffington Post echoes, it’s also a reminder of Tribune Publishing’s short “content curation and monetization engine” era as Tronc.

Samsung is hinting strongly at an Ultra-branded foldable coming soon with this new press release referencing a foldable with a “powerful camera,” which is traditionally a weakness of folding phones. The attached image is also named “Galaxy Z Fold 7 Z Flip 7 Pre tease,” so there’s that too. Between this Ultra model and a rumored FE version of the Z Flip, we might have a whole bunch of new folding phones on our hands later this summer.

Amazon MGM Studios is reportedly making a movie that will depict the rollercoaster couple of days in November 2023 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was ousted by the board, then pulled an “Uno Reverse” and was re-hired, after which nearly all of the board members in question subsequently departed. Luca Guadagnino is in talks to direct, according to The Hollywood Reporter, with Andrew Garfield in talks to play Sam Altman. Production could begin as soon as this summer, per the report, with filming locations in San Francisco and Italy.

Meta and Yandex were tracking Android users’ browsing data far more closely than they should have been, according to researchers. They bypassed the Android “sandbox” in some browsers, letting them de-anonymize users, track how they browse, and then use that data in native Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex apps. Google is investigating the issue, saying that the companies used “capabilities present in many browsers across iOS and Android in unintended ways that blatantly violate our security and privacy principles.” In statements to Ars Technica, Meta and Yandex said they have discontinued the tracking, while denying wrongdoing.
